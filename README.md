# ANN forcasting for supply chain management 
This project was designed to evaluate different forcasting methods used in Power generation to predict demand.
An important phenomenon that occurs in the supply chain is the bullwhip effect. It is the amplification in the 
prediction of demand by the stakeholders along upstream in the supply chain.

To minimize this we have exponential smoothing, Na¨ıve Forecasting and  moving average. Our analysis is to evaluate 
if ANN iis better than these algorithims.

The analysis is done using MATLAB’s Artificial Neural networks library. The algorithm selected for this analysis was 
Bayesian Regularization. Number of neurons selected were 700.

The objective of this paper was to study the bullwhip effect, underlying causes and possible remedies of the bullwhip 
effect in supply chains, and show the effectiveness of demand forecasting models using quantitative and graphical approach. 
One of the major aim is
to become fully integrated. However, this may not be possible due
to difference of strategies and goals. Hence, new advanced techniques
like artificial neural network can be employed to accurately
forecast demand and order batching. The increase in accuracy of
demand information will help to reduce the bullwhip effect. Hence,
demand forecasting using artificial neural network instead of traditional
techniques is valid and practical approach to reduce the
inefficiencies due to the amplification in rate of change of demands.
The results of this paper shows that the artificial neural network
forecasts accuracy is better than the traditional approaches. With
smart grid system being introduced, this new approach will become
more efficient as we would have more data to train, as well as
more inputs that can be a deciding factor on the change of electric
demand at a particular time. Hence reducing power outages due
to high demand.
